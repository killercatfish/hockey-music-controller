# Quick Start: Custom Start Times

## What Is It?

Set tracks to start at a specific time (e.g., skip the first 15 seconds). Perfect for:
- Tracks with long intros
- Songs that start too slow
- Cloud tracks that won't seek properly

## 3-Step Setup

### Step 1: Right-Click a Track
```
In your playlist, right-click (or Ctrl+Click on Mac) any track
```

### Step 2: Choose "Set Start Time"
```
⏱️ Set Start Time     ← Click this
```

### Step 3: Enter Time
```
Enter: 15        (for 15 seconds)
   or: 1:30      (for 1 minute 30 seconds)
```

Done! The track will now show:
```
⏱️ [0:15] Your Track Name | Artist
```

## Using It

**Just play the track normally!** The start time happens automatically:
- Double-click the track ✓
- Press Enter ✓  
- Press Space ✓
- Use Next (N key) ✓

## Editing or Removing

**Edit:**
1. Right-click the track
2. Choose "✏️ Edit Start Time"
3. Enter new time

**Remove:**
1. Right-click the track
2. Choose "🗑️ Remove Start Time"

## Pro Tips

- **Cloud tracks**: Set start times for tracks from Tune My Music that won't seek
- **Batch setup**: Set start times for all your stoppage tracks at once
- **Perfect timing**: Use seconds for precise control (e.g., `23` for 23 seconds)
- **Saved forever**: Start times persist between sessions

## Examples

| Track | Problem | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Thunderstruck | 10 second intro | Set to `0:10` |
| We Will Rock You | Slow start | Set to `0:05` |
| Welcome to the Jungle | Long buildup | Set to `0:15` |
| Seven Nation Army | Starts too quiet | Set to `0:08` |

## Troubleshooting

**Track still starts at beginning?**
- Check that the indicator `⏱️ [0:XX]` is shown
- Try setting the time again
- Make sure the track name matches exactly

**Start time not saved?**
- Check that `~/hockey_music_config.json` exists and is writable
- Restart the app to reload config

**Wrong time?**
- Right-click → "Edit Start Time"
- Or remove and set again
